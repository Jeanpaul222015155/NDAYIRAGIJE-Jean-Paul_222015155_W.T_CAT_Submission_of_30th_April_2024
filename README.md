Worker Information system: It manages employee data, project assignments, and organizational structure within a company.
It starts with user authentication, where employees and administrators log in using credentials stored in the users table,
which also defines their roles and access permissions. Worker details, worker id, full names, Date of birth, gender
contact number, Address and skills, are maintained in the workerinfor table, allowing HR personnel to track and update worker data.
The system organizes employees into departments, defined in the departments table, each with a unique ID, name, and a designated head.
The projects table holds information about various projects, including the department responsible for each project, 
along with start and end dates. The assignments table links workers to specific projects, tracking who
is assigned to each task and for how long.

By integrating these tables, the Worker Information System allows for efficient workforce management, department organization,
project tracking, and assignment management, all while maintaining role-based access control.
